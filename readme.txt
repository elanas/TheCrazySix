Our list of things to fix are listed below:
1.	Format Text to be readable
2.	Add all keyboard commands to how to play screen and add How To Play to menu
2.	Visible and accurate health bar
3.  Visible and accurate timer
1.	Add sound effect on collide
2.	Blinking character on collide
6.	Add smooth transition to next level
7.	Make all graphics consistent to theme
8.	Facilitate moving through doorways
10.	Make syringe level achieveable 
** We added different colored syringes before the assignment was posted
To format the text to be readable against our background we made images of the text so we could add a border to the bolded text, since there was no reasonable way to do it with pygame. We added made sure all necessary commands were on the how to play screen and we added the How to Play screen to the menu screen by making it a game state. We fixed the health bar by discarding the number counter and replacing it with an actual health bar that indicate the percent of health the player currently still has. We modified the health bar so that the health bar respectively blinks green or red when the player gains or loses health points. We fixed the timer so that it only counts in seconds rather than milliseconds and the timer only counts up so the player doesn't feel pressured to finish in a certain amount of time. We also modified the scoring system such that though there is no time constraint, the player recieves extra points for finishing a level within a certain amount of time. We added the sound effect on collide the same way we used the sound effect with the player colliding with the wall, but we changed the collision sound to play with the sryinge collision. We added the blinking character on collide with the syringe the same way we added the blinking collision with the enemies on the next level. To make the level to level transitions smoother, we added a fade in and fade out at the beginning and end of each level. We researched new graphics and all decided on a theme that made sense with our game. Since we have a level editor and map definition file, it was easy to replace all the old graphics with the new ones and to edit our current levels with the new graphics. We made the player graphic smaller so that it would take up a smaller number of tiles and thus easily get through the doorways. We made the syringe level achieveable by strategically placing our turrets and adjusting the shooting probablity of different syringes. Our non-functional adjustments included making the generic level class actually generic by creating many overrideable functions so a level can be as unique as it wants but only needs to have code for its sepcial effects. We also organized our git so that there is no unneccessary files and all the folders and files are more coherent.
