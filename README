Assignment 12:

This is our final product for our game, "Field Day". We added some more 
customization to the final level including a BossEnemy and other 
enemies that actively follow the main player. In addition we 
added an attack move to the main player in 
order to fight back against enemies.

We also added some more tiles with other functionality
and cleaned up the code. In addition, we fully implemented the custom
level editor into the game.

We also added game controller support to a Wii-remote and fixed
all glitches from previous assignments.


Cheats:

Press: '1' - skip current level
Press: '2' - restores health

pep8 notes:

Some classes make use of a 'has_key()' method that pep8 does not
like. This is because the has_key method in HUDManager triggers
some depracation note that we have chosen to disregard.

The Enemy and Level class trigger a under-indented error that
cannot be reasonable solved. The alternative makes the code less 
readable than with the pep8. We have chosen to keep
the code the way it is.
