Add enemies to Game
    - they already are animated (note this in README)
    - Can handle map collisions (walls/objects) in the same way the Player does
Intermediate GameState to get Player's name
    - likely will use keyboard input for now (later has to support gamepad, but not yet)
    - this will either be saved in Globals or sent along to the Player
Player changes
    - check for enemy collisions and take damage (use health bar)
    - maybe fix outrunning camera and/or speed? not super important
    - maybe fix stair collision (happens to suddenly atm)
    - Make HealthBar class
        * makes changing the way it's draw much easier
    - Make Score class
        * makes changing the way it's drawn much easier
End Game States
    - Die Screen
    - Win Screen
        * these are very related but will likely have different text and/or graphics
    - both are sent Player's name, Score class instance, HealthBar class instance
    - gives points based off of current score and remaining health if any
HighScore screen
    - optionally receives current Player's name and score
    - has to load and save from text file
    - has to display high scores or a placeholder (ex: N/A or a dash) if not enough exist
